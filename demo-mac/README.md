# demo-mac

Minimal winit + wgpu host probe for scrying's macOS WKWebView producer.
Counterpart to [`../demo-win`](../demo-win/) on Windows.

The demo's job is to **drive scrying's runtime paths from a real
event loop** so the producer's many slices (lifecycle, navigation,
input forwarding, JS messaging, snapshots, ScreenCaptureKit pipeline,
KVO observers, per-profile data store, etc.) get exercised against
actual AppKit / WebKit / Metal — not just compile-tested.

## Modes

By default the demo opens an overlay-mode WebView at
`https://example.com` and idles, logging navigation events and JS
messages to stdout. The CLI flags below add automated test modes.

### `--probe-snapshot`

Requests a CPU snapshot ~3 s after launch via the non-blocking
[`request_snapshot`](../scrying/src/wkwebview_producer.rs) /
[`poll_snapshot`](../scrying/src/wkwebview_producer.rs) pair, writes
it to `demo-mac-snapshot.png`, and exits. Automated proof-of-life for
slice F (no interactive input required).

### `--scripted`

Loads an inline test page with known DOM (input box + JS message
listener + scrollable region) and drives a state machine that:

- posts a host message and asserts the JS shim echoes it back
  → **slice E** (bidirectional JS messaging) full round-trip
- dispatches 6 scroll-wheel events
  → **slice G** (CGEvent → NSEvent → `scrollWheel:`) API-level
- dispatches 3 keyDown/keyUp pairs typing `abc`
  → **slice I** (`keyEventWithType:` → `keyDown:` / `keyUp:`)
  API-level

Prints `PASS` / `FAIL` and exits. The keyboard / scroll DOM-effect
assertions are best-effort because synthetic events from an offscreen
or unfocused window are filtered by WebKit's hit-testing — slice E,
which round-trips through the `chrome.webview` shim, is the strongest
end-to-end demonstration. G/I are asserted at the API-dispatch level.

### `--capture`

Sets up a Metal-backed wgpu surface tied to the winit window,
positions the WKWebView at the **left half** of the window, kicks
off [`start_capture_async`](../scrying/src/wkwebview_producer.rs)
~3 s after launch, and once `capture_status` reports `Live` starts
rendering each imported `wgpu::Texture` to the right half of the
surface (with a slight tint so the wgpu-rendered region is
distinguishable from the directly-composited WKWebView subview on
the left).

Verifies, end-to-end:

- Slice B (ScreenCaptureKit pipeline)
- Slice M2 (`native_frame::metal::import` — `wgpu::hal::metal::Device::texture_from_raw`)
- Slice N (`SCStream::updateConfiguration:` on resize, when paired
  with `--resize-test`)

### `--capture --dump-every N`

Every Nth imported texture is read back via `copy_texture_to_buffer`
and saved as `demo-mac-frame-NNNN.png`. Pixel-faithful proof of the
IOSurface → MTLTexture → wgpu chain.

### `--capture --resize-test`

Programmatically resizes the window mid-run on a 6/10/14 s schedule.
Each resize triggers the producer's `resize` and (because capture is
live) `SCStream::updateConfiguration:`. Verifies slice N at runtime;
combine with `--dump-every` to see captures at the new dimensions.

### `--browser-test`

Drives items 1, 3, 4, and 9 of the browser-class roadmap on a timed
schedule and asserts deterministic effects:

- **Item 1 — history controls**: registers a `scrying-test://` URL
  scheme, loads `scrying-test://history-1` then
  `scrying-test://history-2`, calls `go_back` and `go_forward`,
  observes the round-trip via `SourceChanged` nav events.
- **Item 3 — settings**: calls `apply_settings(zoom=1.5,
  user_agent=…, javascript_enabled=true, devtools_enabled=false)`,
  asserts `Ok`.
- **Item 4 — URL schemes**: any navigation to `scrying-test://*`
  succeeds via the registered scheme handler. Verified by item 1's
  navigation events.
- **Item 9 — find / PDF**: navigates to a page containing the
  marker `scrying-find-marker`, calls `find_in_page`, asserts
  `poll_find_match → Some(true)`. Then `request_pdf` and asserts
  `poll_pdf → Some(Ok(>100 bytes))`.

Items 2, 5, 6 (new-window intercept, process-failure recovery,
auth challenges) need network or harder-to-trigger conditions
and aren't covered by `--browser-test`. They'll pick up runtime
coverage as mere drives them. Item 8 (downloads) has its own
mode — see [`--download-test`](#--download-test) below.

### `--interaction-state-test`

Loads three pages via the `scrying-test://` scheme, serializes
the interaction state at the third, walks `go_back` twice so the
back-forward cursor is at the first page, restores the captured
blob, and asserts the WebView ends up back at the third page
with `can_go_back == true` / `can_go_forward == false`. Verifies
`serialize_interaction_state` ↔ `restore_interaction_state`
round-trip preserves the WebKit-internal back-forward list.

### `--pointer-input-test`

Loads a page with `pointerdown` / `pointermove` / `pointerup` /
`pointerleave` listeners that bridge each event to the JS host
bridge, then synthesizes Down → Update → Up → Leave via
`send_pointer_input` (with `PointerDevice::Touch`). Asserts the
JS side observes `pointerdown`, `pointermove`, and `pointerup`,
and records the JS-reported `pointerType` so the
"macOS collapses every device to mouse" mapping is documented.

### `--incognito-test`

Stands up two producers in one process: one with
`non_persistent = true`, one persistent at a separate `data_dir`.
Sets a uniquely-named cookie via `set_cookie` on the incognito
producer, queries both stores via `request_all_cookies` /
`poll_cookies`, and asserts the cookie is visible to the
incognito producer but absent from the persistent one — proves
non-persistent stores stay isolated from persistent ones.

### `--download-test`

Spins up a loopback HTTP server (random `127.0.0.1:0` port)
serving a 64 KiB known-pattern body with
`Content-Disposition: attachment`, then drives three sub-phases:

- **Basic**: navigates to the loopback URL, asserts
  `DownloadStarted`/`DownloadProgress`/`DownloadFinished` events
  carry a real `DownloadId` and `destination_path`, and that the
  bytes on disk byte-for-byte match what was served.
- **Host Cancel decision**: registers a `set_download_handler`
  that returns `DownloadDecision::Cancel`, triggers a second
  download, asserts `DownloadCancelled` fires for a fresh ID
  *without* either `DownloadStarted` or `DownloadFinished` for
  that ID.
- **`cancel_download(unknown_id)`**: asserts the API returns
  `Ok(false)` for an ID that was never issued.

The HTTP-server detour is necessary because WebKit doesn't
promote custom URL-scheme responses to downloads regardless of
MIME type or `decidePolicyForNavigationResponse:` override.

### `--capture-test`

Smoke test for the ScreenCaptureKit pipeline. Implies
`--capture` (so the wgpu render context, half-window webview,
and `start_capture_async` kickoff all light up) and forces
`--visible` (SCK can't bind an `SCContentFilter` to a hidden
window). Once `capture_status` reports `Live`, drains 5 frames
via `try_acquire_frame` and asserts each frame's reported
`(width, height)` matches the configured webview size.

ScreenCaptureKit's status-only callbacks are counted in capture diagnostics
without replacing the latest unconsumed image. A burst of Idle callbacks must
leave that image available to the host; a newer image replaces it and releases
the older sample. The hardware workflow checks this custody rule before the
native capture modes. The live gates retain five frames at the base size and
three at each resize size within the existing thirty-second live-stream window.

The default `scripts/test-mac.sh` suite still holds this out because Screen
Recording permission can't be granted from inside the test process. Trusted
headed runners with a pre-grant execute it through `CAPTURE=1`; that suite also
runs `--capture-test --resize-test` and requires repeated frames at every
scheduled capture size. Run either gate manually:

```bash
cargo run -p demo-mac -- --capture-test
cargo run -p demo-mac -- --capture-test --resize-test
```

The self-hosted hardware workflow runs the full suite with
`VISIBLE=1 CAPTURE=1`. `VISIBLE=1` adds `--visible` to the modes that normally
hide their AppKit window and launches the built binary from a stable `.app`
through LaunchServices. That gives WKWebView and ScreenCaptureKit the logged-in
GUI context that a runner-spawned binary lacks. The hosted macOS workflow keeps
the default headless, direct-executable behavior. The bounded two-tab assertion
is already visible and retains its auto-exit deadline.

### `--profile-test`

Persistent-store complement to [`--incognito-test`](#--incognito-test):
asserts that two persistent producers at the **same** `data_dir`
share their cookie store. Stands up a primary + a secondary
producer at a PID-suffixed `target/demo-mac-profile-test-<pid>/`
path, sets a uniquely-named cookie on producer #1 via the
`set_cookie` API, then queries both producers' stores via
`request_all_cookies` and asserts the cookie shows up in both.
Proves `WKWebsiteDataStore::dataStoreForIdentifier:` returns the
same backing store for the same path-derived UUID across
producer instances. Self-contained — no manual two-run flow.

### `--two-tabs`

Multi-instance independence assertion (browser-class item 7):
two producers in one process, both subviews of the host
window, navigating independently to distinct
`scrying-test://` URLs. Drains nav events from each
producer's queue and asserts tab #1 saw history-1 events
(and not history-2), and vice versa — proving multiple
producers in one process keep independent event streams with
no cross-talk.

## Interactive keys

Outside test modes, the following hot-keys work:

- `S`: request a CPU snapshot. The completion handler writes
  `demo-mac-snapshot.png` when ready.
- `M`: post a JS-side host message
  (`window.chrome.webview.addEventListener('message', ...)`
  recipients see it).

All other input (typing, clicks, scrolls) goes to the WKWebView
via AppKit's natural responder chain — the demo doesn't
double-dispatch through `send_mouse_input` / `send_keyboard_input`
in overlay mode (that path is gated to `--capture` mode, where
the WKWebView is rendering into a captured texture and is
therefore not directly clickable).

## Architecture

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `src/main.rs` | winit application handler, event routing, scripted state machine |
| `src/render.rs` | wgpu surface + import + render pipeline + readback |

The demo only depends on **stable scrying APIs** — no internal types,
no SPI. If you can build and run this, downstream consumers will be
able to wire up scrying the same way.

## Known runtime caveats observed during development

- **Blocking trait methods deadlock from inside winit handlers.**
  `navigate_to_url`, `navigate_to_string`, `capture_cpu_snapshot`,
  and `start_capture` all pump the main `NSRunLoop` to wait on a
  delegate callback. From inside winit's `resumed` /
  `window_event` (which runs *under* the same NSRunLoop), the pump
  re-enters winit's event handler and trips its
  "no nested event handling" guard, panicking. **Always prefer the
  non-blocking inherent variants** (`load_url`, `load_html`,
  `request_snapshot` + `poll_snapshot`, `start_capture_async` +
  `capture_status`) when calling from a host event-loop callback.
- **Synthetic input is filtered when the window isn't user-focused.**
  WebKit's hit-testing accepts AppKit-routed events but may ignore
  events delivered straight to the responder methods if the window
  isn't on top. The producer dispatches them correctly; whether
  WebKit acts on them is downstream of scrying's contract.
- **Capture mode shows recursive content.** SCK captures the entire
  window framebuffer. Our wgpu surface displays the imported texture.
  In capture mode that texture *includes* our previous render's
  output, so the right half visibly shows nested capture frames.
  Not a bug — a consequence of capturing the same window we render
  into. Production consumers will typically render capture into a
  *different* window or surface.
