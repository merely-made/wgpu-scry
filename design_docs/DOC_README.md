# Wgpu-scry documentation

This is the canonical index for active documentation in this repository.

## Working principles

- Keep compile coverage, imported-resource shape, pixel correctness, and
  headed hardware receipts as separate claims.
- A DOM/title change and imported-frame count do not prove final static pixel
  freshness; coalesced capture notifications must account for queued samples.
- Scrying owns system-webview adaptation and frame production. The host owns
  windowing, embedding, navigation policy, storage policy, and fallback choice.
- Keep the feature-selected wgpu row identical to the host row and re-export
  the selected types at the public boundary.
- Publish and tag the exact source being described. Once a crate version is on
  crates.io, later public API work receives a new version.
- Treat `README.md`, `scrying/README.md`, and `docs/parity-matrix.md` as current
  public guidance and reconcile them when a platform receipt changes.
